Homework Assignment 02 - Responsive Portfolio

## Description

This assignment involves creating a portfolio website with responsive design using the Bootstrap CSS framework. 
The goal is to create a mobile responsive portfolio and ensure that the web application created renders well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. 

## My contribution

* Using Bootstrap CSS framework, developed my portfolio site using the provided images as a reference. This  application contains my personal information like name, interests, images, link to social media, etc. via the following 3 different web pages:
    - About Me 
    - Portfolio
    - Contact

* All the pages contain 
    - A navbar, which is consistent on each page and contains links to About, Contact and Portfolio pages.
    - Responsive layout using Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows and columns)
    - Responsive images using Bootstrap class

* Minimized custom CSS styling by using Bootstrap classes wherever possible.
* As a best practice, avoided overridding the Bootstrap classes directly by creating custom classes for further styling.
* Created a favicon that represents my website.
* Used semantic HTML for search engine optimization and accessibility.
* Implemented the bonus by making a sticky footer which will stick to the bottom of the viewport in cases where the content is shorther than the viewport height.
* Used the W3C MarkUp Validation service (https://validator.w3.org/) to validate all the HTNL files and no errors were reported.
